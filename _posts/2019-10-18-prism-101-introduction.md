## Meetup Prism 101 - Introduction

The last week I were talking about a MVVM framework called [Prism](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism) in the Xamarin Madrid Meetup group. Let me share with you the two Youtube videos (spanish audio) with the full content. It was my first Meetup as presenter but maybe not the last.

You can download the repo from my [Github](https://github.com/MookieFumi/Prism.101/tree/feature/prism).

See the first video in Youtube.
