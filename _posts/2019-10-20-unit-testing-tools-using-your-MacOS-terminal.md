## Unit testing tools using your MacOS terminal

I´ve been a MacOS user for many years and I ´ve been working with **Visual Studio for Mac** & **Mono Studio** and let me say that the tooling to work with unit testing is not enough so I had to include new tools to work easily.

When I run my tests in a terminal window or in Visual Studio for Mac, the information they give me it´s only the final test result:

```bash
dotnet test NBAStats.Core.Test.csproj

Starting test execution, please wait...

A total of 1 test files matched the specified pattern.

Test Run Successful.
Total tests: 11
     Passed: 11
 Total time: 1.4090 Seconds
```

It´s good but maybe it´s not enough. So how can we get more information about our testing? There are some "new" tools that help us to get more information like:

### Coverlet

Coverlet is a cross platform code coverage framework for .NET, with support for line, branch and method coverage. It works with .NET Framework on Windows and .NET Core on all supported platforms.

<https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet>

It has different integrations, VsTest, MSBuild and Dotnet Global tool but let me show you only the integration with MSBuild. To use it, we have to include the **coverlet.msbuild** package in our test project. So now we can execute the unit test collecting code coverage data.

```bash
dotnet test NBAStats.Core.Test.csproj /p:CollectCoverage=true

Starting test execution, please wait...

A total of 1 test files matched the specified pattern.

Test Run Successful.
Total tests: 11
     Passed: 11
 Total time: 1.4193 Seconds

Calculating coverage result...

+---------------+--------+--------+--------+
| Module        | Line   | Branch | Method |
+---------------+--------+--------+--------+
| NBAStats.Core | 20.44% | 14.78% | 20.12% |
+---------------+--------+--------+--------+

+---------+--------+--------+--------+
|         | Line   | Branch | Method |
+---------+--------+--------+--------+
| Total   | 20.44% | 14.78% | 20.12% |
+---------+--------+--------+--------+
| Average | 20.44% | 14.78% | 20.12% |
+---------+--------+--------+--------+
```

As you can see the last lines are regarding with the calculation of coverage. *Please don´t consider the 20%, it´s only a demo*.

Coverlet has multiple interesting options but my favorite one is to setup the output format because it´s compatible with:

* json (default)
* lcov
* opencover
* cobertura

So, if we want to create a report with the opencover format in the directory *../coverage/* we should execute:

```bash
dotnet test NBAStats.Core.Test.csproj /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutput=../coverage/ /p:CoverletOutputFormat=opencover

Starting test execution, please wait...
.
.
.
.
Calculating coverage result...
  Generating report '../coverage/coverage.opencover.xml'
```

In my case, I usually don´t want to check the code coverage in my Views so I add an exclusion that exclude all the files in the Views namespace.

```bash
dotnet test src/NBAStats.Core.Test/NBAStats.Core.Test.csproj /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutput=../coverage/ /p:CoverletOutputFormat=opencover /p:Exclude="[*]*.Views.*"
```

### ReportGenerator

ReportGenerator converts coverage reports generated by OpenCover, dotCover, Visual Studio, NCover, Cobertura, JaCoCo, Clover, gcov or lcov into human readable reports in various formats.

Depends on our platform and needs, we have to intall a different package, in this case, we are going to use the dotnet global flavour.

```bash
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
```

So, if we want to export our previous opencover report in HTMLInline format we should execute:

```bash
reportgenerator "-reports:src/coverage/*.xml" "-reporttypes:HTMLInline" "-targetdir:src/coverage/report"

```

If you open the generated htm file (*src/coverage/report/index.htm'*) you can see a summary of the code coverage and you can click on every namespace or class to navigate to the detail.
