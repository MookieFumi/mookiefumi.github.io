## Unit testing tools using VSCode

This post is the second part of the post [Unit testing tools using your MacOS terminal](http://mookiefumi.com/2019-10-20-unit-testing-tools-using-your-MacOS-terminal). They are related because the topic it's the unit testing and the tools we have mainly in MacOS (they existing in Windows/ Linux enviroments too).

Since I've been developing .Net Standard libraries I had to include a new tool in my tool belt, but this time, it wasn't a new IDE. The choosen one was an editor. **Visual Studio Code** helps me to code my .Net Standard projects/ libraries, cover them with unit testing I have only need some amaizing VSCode extensions that give me more information about the unit testing like code coverage.

### VSCode Extensions

#### .NET Core Test Explorer

It's a VSCode's extension that allow us to see our available tests in a window with a treeview splitted by namespace and if we open a test class we can run or debug the test methods. I have configured the next parameters:

* **Test Project Path**, in the current example I added "**/*.Test.csproj".
* As well, I usually add **Test Arguments** in order to generate code coverage info in lcov format that it's compatible with the Coverage Gutters extension, in the current example I added:

```bash
/p:CollectCoverage=true
/p:CoverletOutputFormat=lcov
/p:CoverletOutput=../coverage/lcov.info
```

If you want to export to multiple formats at the same  you add them with:

```bash
/p:CoverletOutputFormat=\"opencover,lcov,cobertura\"
```

Once the extension is installed you'll see a new icon in the right toolbar called Test and if you click on it you'll see the available unit tests grouped by namespace.

> From here you can run the tests of every tree node.

#### Coverage Gutters

It's a VSCode's extension that allow us to check the test coverage generated and works with many languages so also works with C#. It's useful to activate the "Show Line Coverage" and "Show Gutter Coverage" options.

The extension expects to find a compatible file with lcov format (*lcov.info, coverage.info*) so if we don't run the tests without the previous params it will not work.

> With these configured tools everytime you open a file in the solution you'll see the lines covered.

If you execute the **ReportGenerator** tool to convert the generated code coverage report in lcov format to Html you can open it directly from the VSCode command palette: **Coverage Gutters - Preview Coverage Report** and you'll see the report integrated in VSCode.

```bash
reportgenerator "-reports:src/coverage/*.xml" "-reporttypes:HTMLInline" "-targetdir:src/coverage/report"
```

If you want to have available badges of the code coverage of your projects, you have to include a new report type. ItÂ´s easy with the help of ReportGenerator because it allow us to add multiple report types separated with semicolon.

```bash
reportgenerator "-reports:src/coverage/*.xml" "-reporttypes:HTMLInline;Badges" "-targetdir:src/coverage/report"
```
